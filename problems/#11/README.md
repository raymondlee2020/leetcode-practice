# Problem 11 - Container with Most Water

## V1

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

- Use two pointer concept like #15.
- The container with most water should be wide or high enough, so start from the two side (the largest "width") and move forward the lower side (optimize the "height") to find if there is a larger area (width * height).
