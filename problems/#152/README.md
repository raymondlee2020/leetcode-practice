# Problem 152 - Maximum Product Subarray

## V1

Time Complexity: O(x)

Space Complexity: O(x)

- It's similar to the concept of #53.
- Ascension: consider the characteristic of multiplication, which two negative integers' product is positive, keeping the maximum and minimum (double state) in each subarray is the key point.
