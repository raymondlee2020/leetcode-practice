# Problem 153 - Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## V1

Time Complexity: O(log n)

Space Complexity: O(log n)

- Consider the O(log n) requirement, must keep halving the array to find the minimum.

## V2

Time Complexity: O(log n)

Space Complexity: O(log n)

- Refactor the code by using recurisive function.
