# Problem 23 - Merge k Sorted Lists

## V1

Time Complexity: O(n l)

Space Complexity: O(1)

- Keep finding the min head node among the lists and attach it to the return list.

## V2

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

- Priority queue.
- Floyd's build heap algorithm

## V3

Time Complexity: O(n log l)

Space Complexity: O(n)

- Divide and conquer.
