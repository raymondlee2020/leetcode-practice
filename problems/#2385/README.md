# Problem 2385 - Amount of Time for Binary Tree to Be Infected

## V1

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

- Max in the following conditions.
    - The tree with root "start" (its height).
    - Each tree contains node "start" (1 + the depth of "start" in the subtree + the height of the other one).
