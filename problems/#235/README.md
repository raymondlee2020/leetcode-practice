# Problem 235 - Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

## V1

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n^2)

- Leverage BFS and hashmap.

## V2

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(log n)

- DFS.
- Check if subtree has p or q.

## V3

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

- BST traversal.
